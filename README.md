Replication materials for 'The Calculus of Suspicion: A Rational Reconstruction of Kautilya’s Small-n Verification Protocol.
This repository supports my paper. The Safety Elbow (n=3) is the robust optimum under Mauryan coordination frictions (gamma=15).
The model utilizes a high friction coefficient (gamma=15) to proxy for Mauryan Labor Market Dualism, where the extreme scarcity of elite bureaucratic labor makes large-scale verification networks fiscally and organizationally prohibitive.
Elite Scarcity as a Driver: The high friction coefficient  is not an arbitrary penalty; it is the institutional response to an inelastic elite pool21212121.+1The Quadratic Constraint: Because the supply of literate, trustworthy agents was limited in the Mauryan economy, scaling the network (n > 3) forced the state to divert scarce human capital, making the cost of maintaining isolated pairwise links rise super-linearly.+1Macroeconomic Parallel: This mirrors the difficulty modern developing states face when trying to estimate trade-offs like the Phillips Curve in the presence of structural labor dualism and unobservable supply-side shocks.
